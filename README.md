If you own a phoney, you don't have to read any Terms and Conditions -- you own the full IP and have all the commercial rights in the world.

Noodles (yes, we were first) stand for full ownership and remind you to read everything before committing your capital to overhyped projects.
Clones made $160M and you still own nothing 🙂.
